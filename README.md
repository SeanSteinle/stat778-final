# STAT778 Final Project
***Sean Steinle***

This repository contains my final project for STAT778 at GMU.

## How To Run

To replicate my results for the project, you can either execute the notebooks in *notebooks/* or run the *applied_study.py* and *simulation_study.py* scripts. If you'd like to replicate the HPC results, shell scripts of the same name are available for your convenience. The default experiment length for the scripts is 100,000 timesteps, which should be computed 
on a HPC. To get results on a personal computer, run the notebooks and drop the timesteps as necessary.
